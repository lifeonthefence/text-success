# Text-Success

This project aims to identify which features of Tweets are most important for its success, as measured by the number of retweets. In particular, the project will focus on Tweets about Ukraine and the Ukrainian Russian war in 2022.

Approach taken:

Tweets gathered for the given timeframe along with their metrics of success and other variables.
Natural language processing will be used to clean the dataset and extract features from the texts such as complexity, length, topic, sentiment, and key words.
Based on these features, a model will be trained to assess the relative importance of these in creating ‘successful’ texts.
